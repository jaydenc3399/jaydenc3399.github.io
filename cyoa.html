            <h1 class="margin text-center"> CYOA Porject</h1>
            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>In this project we put the skills that we have learned about github and putting it on the command line, using it in our ide. We were tasked to create a project the "Choose your own Adventure" CYOA. This project was based on the adventures that we picked and was assigned to us.  The topic name of the adventure me and my partner were assigned was "Time Traveling". We were each assigned one partner to work with and my partner was Tina. This project helped us to practice our skills on communicating and also working collaborativley with others and to practice our new skills, the git commands.  </p>
            <h3>Content</h3>
            <p>Me and my partner made a story using git commands about time traveling and you get to decide your own choices. We first started off by planning the route that we would take using google drawings, linking files and folders and connecting them together, planning out where each folder takes you. After planning and switching some things up we started to create the project. Viewers have the choice to choose between two portals. Inside the closet is four portals. Each portal leads to a special place or death based on the one that you choose. </p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>A challenge that I faced when doing the project was finding an avaliable time where both me and my partner were avaliable. We both had different times that we were avaliable so it was a little challenging to work on the project together. Since this was a collaborative project where me and my partner would both have to do both git pull and git push and get ideas from her about the project. I needed their input on certain things and we each worked on the project at seperate times on our own. It just made things a little more challenging and some more cooperation and work. In the end we communicated and we were able to come up with one set time where we were both avaliable to work on the project and we did this by texting each other using slack. Sharing our ideas for the project and also telling each other when we should git push or git pull. Another challenge that I faced was with the ide problems, this caused me to not be able to work on the project untill it was fixed. However I did not know how to solve this problem, after countless tries. I overcame this challenge by asking my partner if they knew how to fix this problem at first and they were unsure, so after I asked my friend and he was able to help fix it for me and I was able to work on the project again.
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>Some takeaways from this project/challenge is to always have good communication with your partner and peers. Through good communication I was able to build that bond with my partner and this helped us to both overcome the problems and come up with a solution to the conflict or problem. Also using communication apps like slack also helped us to resolve project questions. Having peers that I can ask questions to, helped me with personal growth and better improve my learning. </p>
            <h3>Next steps</h3>
            <p>Something that I would do differently would be to brainstorm in a better way because me and my partner were very unprepared when we started to code the actual project. We had no idea where certain things went and connected and what to put inside the files. This caused us to take our coding time just to think about and brainstorm what we should do next. This was a reminder and a note to us to use some extra time brainstorming before starting the code and using that time wisley and putting in clear detailed, and contexulized thoughts.</p>
