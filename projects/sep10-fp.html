            <h1 class="margin text-center">SEP 10 Freedom Project</h1>
            <p>I am a student at HSTAT in the Software Engineering Program. The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing. I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study animation in order to help me make my website.</p>
            <p>For my project, I chose the topic of Sports Technology. The purpose of the freedom project is to create various possible future innovations in the field that we have researched about using our imagination, embracing the word "freedom" and putting no limit on our imagination and brains. My project was about sports and different types of sports apps, hardwares and other things that could be used in the future including the current inventions. These inventions were meant to help people, especially athletes, enhancing and take their game to the next level. Inventions like holographic fields where it is convenient to use anywhere and anytime without walking to places like the part. Also robots that can help grab equipment back for you so you dont have to do much work. This was just some of the innovations that I thought of that could be beneficial to many people and athletes.</p>
            <a href="#">Link about the project</a><br>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>Challenges that I faced while creating this project was trying to stay motivated to continue my project. In the beginning after switching tempalte after template becasue I was unsure of how to start my website. I restarted my webiste over three times, after the third time I was ready to give up because each of those tries I had some progress done. I was so tired of having to restart the code over and over again. I started to just think to myself to just take the 0 and that the freedom project is not really important to me and that the grade wouldnt affect me much. Another challenge that I had was trying to make the cards inside my website responsive where the cards would not stack on top of one another then shift down and making my website look more eye-catching using aniamtion because I was not the type of person to be very creative and have ideas to make a website that people would enjoy looking at or even being amazed at it. </p>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>Some takeaways that I had while creating this project was patience because me I have very little patience for things and I always tend to give up on hard task really easily. For coding taking time to try to understand it and having friends as a support system to help you and guide you through these times where you are stuck and dont know where to continue. They gave me in a way help and motivation to start my website over again after failing over three times in a row, showing how failure can lead to success as now I have a full developed website. My friends helped me chip away part of my code one by one untill the whole code was done. Another takeaway that I had is for fixing the responsiveness of my whole website especially my cards where they would stack on top of each other when the screen is minimized. The trasnition was just not smooth so by adding meda queries this helped maked the trasnition from a computer device to a mobile one more smooth and looks better also.   </p>
